Stage started successfully

Python version: 59011
Will NOT recombine or retitle input ligands
There will be 1 subjobs.
Will identify ligands based on unique field: s_vsw_compound_code
Counting numbers of structures and compounds in input ligands...
......
Number of input compounds: 3868
Number of input structures: 6778

Input number of poses for each subjob:
{1: 6778}

NOTE: 1 jobs will be launched, as that's the number of input files. (The option to 'use input files directly for subjobs' was used.)
