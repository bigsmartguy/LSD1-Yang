Stage started successfully

Python version: 59011
Will NOT recombine or retitle input ligands
There will be 3 subjobs.
Will identify ligands based on unique field: s_vsw_compound_code
Counting numbers of structures and compounds in input ligands...

Number of input compounds: 580
Number of input structures: 580

Input number of poses for each subjob:
{1: 194, 2: 194, 3: 192}

NOTE: 3 jobs will be launched, as that's the number of input files. (The option to 'use input files directly for subjobs' was used.)

Setting up Glide jobs...

JobDJ columns:
  C: Number of completed subjobs
  A: Number of active subjobs (e.g., submitted, running)
  W: Number of waiting/pending subjobs
