Stage started successfully

Python version: 59011
Will NOT recombine or retitle input ligands
There will be 1 subjobs.
Will identify ligands based on unique field: s_vsw_compound_code
Counting numbers of structures and compounds in input ligands...
.
Number of input compounds: 1934
Number of input structures: 1934

Input number of poses for each subjob:
{1: 1934}

NOTE: 1 jobs will be launched, as that's the number of input files. (The option to 'use input files directly for subjobs' was used.)
