Python version: 59011
Will NOT recombine or retitle input ligands
There will be 2 subjobs.
Will identify ligands based on unique field: s_vsw_compound_code
Counting numbers of structures and compounds in input ligands...

Number of input compounds: 303
Number of input structures: 303

Input number of poses for each subjob:
{1: 152, 2: 151}

NOTE: 2 jobs will be launched, as that's the number of input files. (The option to 'use input files directly for subjobs' was used.)
